      <p>Zoos are places where wild animals are kept for public display. Zoos are often the sites of sophisticated breeding centers, where endangered species may be protected and studied. Some zoos, like this aquarium in Monterey, California, are dedicated to one species or set of species. Aquariums are dedicated to the display of aquatic creatures.</p>

        Captive breeding of endangered species makes zoos valuable places for animal survival. Animals such as the black soft-shelled turtle, native to India and Bangladesh, are extinct in the wild. But they survive in several zoos around the world, with their health looked after by biologists.

        The goal of many captive breeding programs at zoos is the re-introduction of animals into the wild. Zoos often have conservation projects in the native habitats of the animals they keep in captivity.
